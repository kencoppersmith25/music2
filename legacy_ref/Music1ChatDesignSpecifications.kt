        DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
        Status: APPROVED

        • Music1Chat is designed for people whose attention is occupied
          elsewhere.

        • Important use cases include:
            - Bicycle riding
            - Walking
            - Driving
            - Working
            - Exercising
            - Navigating
            - Other activities where the user should not study the screen

        • Common actions must require very little interaction.

        • Primary controls should be large, obvious, and easy to operate.

        • The user should be able to control music through:
            - Large on-screen buttons
            - Bluetooth controls
            - Other supported external media controls

        • The app should provide substantial control without requiring the
          user to repeatedly remove the phone from a pocket.

        • Stations should be organized according to how the user actually
          listens, not only by musical genre.

        Examples:
            - Classical
            - Jazz
            - Bike Ride
            - Bike Ride 1
            - Relaxing
            - Road Trip
            - Work
            - News

        • Frequent actions should be immediately available.

        • Less common actions should remain available without cluttering the
          main listening screen.

        Rationale:

        Music1Chat began largely because existing music applications did not
        provide the simple category and station navigation needed while
        bicycle riding.

    val CATEGORY_MODEL = """
        CATEGORY MODEL
        Status: APPROVED

        • Every navigable collection of stations is called a Category.

        • The word Category should be used consistently throughout the app.

        • Do not introduce a separate user-facing term such as Folder or
          Collection unless a later design decision changes the terminology.

        • Categories may originate in different ways:
            - Standard categories
            - User-created categories
            - Search categories

        • Category origin may affect internal behavior, but all are presented
          to the user as categories.

        • A standard category such as Classical is not fundamentally
          different from a user-created category such as Ken's Bike Ride.

        • All categories are persistent.

        • A category remains available until the user deliberately deletes it.

        • Every category may be hearted or unhearted.

        • A hearted category participates in Previous Category and
          Next Category navigation.

        • An unhearted category remains in the app but is skipped during
          category navigation.

        • Category navigation may be initiated through:
            - Main-screen controls
            - Bluetooth controls
            - Other supported media controls

        Rationale:

        The user should not need to remember different navigation rules for
        different kinds of categories. All categories should feel consistent.

    val STATION_IDENTITY = """
    STATION IDENTITY
    Status: APPROVED

    • A station has one application-wide identity.

    • The preferred identity is the stable station ID or UUID supplied by
      the radio-station directory.

    • If no stable directory ID is available, the normalized stream URL may
      be used as a fallback identity.

    • Station name alone must not be used as identity because:
        - Different stations may have the same name.
        - A station may change its displayed name.
        - Search results may format the same name differently.

    • When a newly discovered result matches an existing station:
        - Reuse the existing station record.
        - Refresh directory-controlled information when appropriate.
        - Do not create a duplicate station.

    • Directory-controlled information may include:
        - Station name
        - Stream URL
        - Artwork URL
        - Homepage
        - Country
        - Language
        - Codec
        - Bitrate

    • User-controlled information must be preserved during refresh:
        - Station heart state
        - Category memberships
        - Position within each category
        - Any user-supplied name or note added later

    • If a directory changes a station's ID unexpectedly but the stream URL
      still matches, the app should attempt to reconcile the records rather
      than immediately creating a duplicate.

    Rationale:

    Search results may rediscover the same station many times. Stable identity
    prevents duplicates while allowing station information to stay current.

    val STATION_MEMBERSHIP = """
        STATION MEMBERSHIP
        Status: APPROVED

        • A station may belong to more than one permanent category.

        Example:

        A station may belong to:
            - Classical
            - Bike Ride
            - Relaxing Evening

        • The station itself should not be duplicated internally merely
          because it belongs to multiple categories.

        • Category membership is a relationship between a station and a
          category.

        • Adding a station to another category does not interrupt playback.

        • Adding a station to another category does not automatically change
          the current category.

        • A station saved from a search category remains in the current
          search results.

        Rationale:

        People organize stations according to both genre and activity. The
        same station may reasonably belong to several categories.

    val SEARCH_CATEGORIES = """
        SEARCH CATEGORIES
        Status: APPROVED

        • Search categories are persistent.

        • A search category does not disappear when the app closes.

        • The user may delete a search category from the category list.

        • A search category permanently stores its search term.

        Examples:
            - Search: Classical
            - Search: Jazz
            - Search: Swing

        • The results of a search category are refreshed during every app
          session.

        • Search categories should be loaded lazily.

        • The app does not perform every saved search during startup.

        • The first time the user enters a search category during an app
          session:
            - Run the stored search again.
            - Replace the previous session's search results.
            - Mark the category as refreshed for the current session.

        • Returning to the category during the same app session reuses the
          current results.

        • The next app session causes another refresh the first time the
          category is entered.

        • Stations may appear, disappear, or change because internet-radio
          stations change over time.

        • Saving a station from a search category does not remove it from the
          search results.

        • The user remains in the search category after saving a station
          unless the user deliberately changes categories.

        Rationale:

        The category and its search term should persist, while its results
        remain fresh. Lazy loading keeps startup quick and avoids performing
        searches the user may never visit during that session.

    • Changing categories selects an eligible station within the destination
      category.

    • The preferred station-selection behavior is:
        - Resume the last successfully played station in that category when
          it is still eligible.
        - Otherwise select the first eligible station in that category's
          stored order.

        - Otherwise choose the first eligible station in category order.

    • The remembered station belongs to the category membership, not merely
      to the global station record.

    • The same station may therefore be remembered independently in several
      categories.

    • Removing the remembered station from a category clears or replaces that
      category's remembered playback position.

    • Reordering stations does not erase the remembered station.

    • A failed station should not become the remembered successful station.

        • Move and Copy remain separate user operations.

        Likely Move destination:

        • The search term provides the strongest clue for the default
          destination.

        • Moving a station from a search category does not remove it from the
          search results.

        • In this situation, Move means saving the station into its expected
          primary permanent category. It does not literally remove it from the

        - Must not abruptly interrupt playback merely because membership was
          removed.
        - Keeps the stream playing until the user changes station, playback
          ends, or another approved rule requires a change.
        - Removes that station from future navigation within that category.

    • If the removed station was the category's remembered station:
        - Replace the remembered station after another station plays
          successfully.
        - Clear it if no replacement exists.

    • Deletion should require confirmation when the action may be difficult
      to reverse or may affect several memberships.

    Rationale:

    A station is shared across categories. Most station deletion actions are
    therefore membership changes, not destruction of the underlying station.

    val CATEGORY_DELETION = """
    CATEGORY DELETION
    Status: APPROVED IN PRINCIPLE

    • Deleting a category removes the category and its station-membership
      records.

    • Deleting a category does not delete shared station records that are
      still used by other categories.

    • The app must clearly identify the category being deleted.

    • Category deletion requires confirmation.

    • The confirmation should explain that:
        - The category itself will be removed.
        - Stations shared with other categories will remain there.
        - The operation does not delete internet-radio stations themselves.

    • If the deleted category is the current category:
        - Select the next eligible hearted category when one exists.
        - Otherwise select the previous eligible category.
        - If no eligible category exists, show "Please search for a genre or station to begin listening"

    • Deleting a search category removes:
        - The saved search category
        - Its stored search term
        - Its current session results
        - Its category-specific playback memory

    • Deleting a user-created category removes:
        - The category
        - Its memberships
        - Its category-specific station order
        - Its category-specific playback memory

    • Standard-category deletion rules may be restricted later if standard
      categories are required by the application.

    Rationale:

    Category deletion should remove the user's organizational container without
    destroying station information that remains useful elsewhere.

            - Play or Stop
            - Next station
            - Next category

        • The central Play or Stop button should be especially large and

        • Single-arrow controls move between stations.

        • Double-arrow controls move between categories.

        • The screen must remain useful when a station provides:
            - Full artwork and song metadata
            - Only its station name
            - Little or no metadata

        • Long station or song text should scroll or otherwise remain

        IMPLEMENTATION PRINCIPLES
        Status: APPROVED

        • Important design decisions should be recorded before or alongside
          implementation.

        • Reusable Compose components should be used where appropriate.

        Likely reusable components:
            - HeartButton
            - CategoryRow
            - StationRow
            - NowPlayingCard
            - PlaybackControls
            - SearchField
            - StatusFooter

        • UI code should avoid unnecessary copies of the same behavior.

        • Persistent data and temporary session data must be clearly
          separated.

        Persistent examples:
            - Category name
            - Category heart state
            - Stored search term
            - User-created station memberships

        Session-only examples:
            - Whether a search category was refreshed this session
